					<p>In 1997, Pete Suazo helped Gladys Gonzalez write a business plan and obtain a loan for her first business in the United States, the newspaper, “Mundo Hispano”. The help she received inspired Gladys to pass on that commitment and service to the entire community.</p>
					<p>After Senator Suazo’s death, in 2001, Gladys gathered support from the greater Salt Lake and Utah communities to create a center to honor Pete Suazo’s name. She sought a means by which to provide the same service, commitment and expertise Pete had given her, and have an avenue to help reach other prospective small business owners.</p>
					<p>With the help and support of Senator Bob Bennett, the Pete Suazo Business Center was created. We opened our doors in 2003, and over these past 15 years, we have continues Pete Suazo’s legacy by helping thousands of minority and underserved entrepreneurs become successful business owners in their communities.</p>
